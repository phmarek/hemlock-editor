About Hemlock

  Hemlock is an Emacs-style editor written in Common Lisp.

  Originally written as a part of CMUCL, work started in 2002 to make it
  portable to other Common Lisp implementations.


Backends

  This version of Hemlock has three backends, of which you need at least
  one:

    * The TTY backend doesn't need much, except for a terminal
      and an installed terminfo database.

    * The X11 backend needs CLX and an X server.

    * The experimental Qt backends needs CommonQt.



Building and invocation of a binary

  ./build.sh
  ./hemlock --help


Building and invocation from the REPL

  (push #p"/path/to/hemlock/" asdf:*central-registry*)
  (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :hemlock.tty)
  (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :hemlock.clx)
  (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :hemlock.qt)

  (hemlock:hemlock)
or just
  (ed)    ;SBCL and CCL only


If you're starting Hemlock via swank, be sure to stop the normal
REPL from eating keypresses from its input: use eg.
  sbcl --eval "(sleep 1000000)"
